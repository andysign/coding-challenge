What is required for this challange:

> **Introduction**

> You are given a string composed of only 1s, 0s, and Xs.

> Write a program that will print out every possible combination where you replace the X with ​ both 0 and 1.

> **Example**

> ```
> $ myprogram X0
> 00
> 10

> $ myprogram 10X10X0
> 1001000
> 1001010
> 1011000
> 1011010
> ```

> While your program will take longer to run based on the number of possible combinations, your program shouldn’t crash (or hang) on an input with many Xs.

> What is the big O notation for your program?
